quadtree collision detection (maybe?)
understand how to use dynamic meshes: how to update index buffer dynamically along with vertex buffer
cache align on Matrix class
monte carlo maybe for AI
dynamic shader generation
make VertexData's vertex attributes general with templating, maybe make use of VertexLayout
